This file is kept for legacy packaging. Please see README.md for the full documentation.
Summary: current release keeps hotkey GIF burst capture with 5/10/15 FPS targets, retains spool-backed burst frame storage (`screenshotRef`) for lower memory pressure, and updates the exported carousel viewer with Workflow Queue labeling, collapsible subsection descriptions, and cleaner section headers without URL/timestamp metadata.
