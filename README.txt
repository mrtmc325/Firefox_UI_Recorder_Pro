UI Workflow Recorder Pro (Firefox) - v1.12.0

This file is kept for legacy packaging. Please see README.md for the full documentation.
Summary: current release keeps hotkey GIF burst capture with 5/10/15 FPS targets, adds spool-backed burst frame storage (`screenshotRef`) for lower memory pressure, and supports raw ZIP bundle v2 (`frame-manifest.json` + `frames/*`) for full-fidelity re-import.
