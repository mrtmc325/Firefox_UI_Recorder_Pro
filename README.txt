Summary: current release keeps hotkey GIF burst capture with 5/10/15 FPS targets, includes spool-backed burst frame storage (`screenshotRef`) for lower memory pressure, hardens burst playback reliability, and aligns the report-builder left controls rail + export-theme editor to popup-style compact settings cards.
